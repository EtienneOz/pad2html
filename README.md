#MDSH2HTML

*Making an semi-automatic website from a pad online*

Right now, it's configure to grab the from this pad :
[http://lite4.framapad.org/p/CompteRenduMarathonTypoLibre2](http://lite4.framapad.org/p/CompteRenduMarathonTypoLibre2)

You can change it inside the script.

To run the script, open a terminal, cd to the directory and type
**bash mdsh2html.sh**

The result is on the tmp directory.

Upload is disabled for now.
